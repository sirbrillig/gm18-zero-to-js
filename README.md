# Zero to JavaScript

> JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world; it is one of the easiest languages to start learning since it requires nothing more than a web browser, but it is also powerful enough to run large-scale servers and native apps. In this class we’ll examine JavaScript’s origins, learn its syntax, and use it to build an actual web app, all without needing any prior programming knowledge.

This is a series of slides for the "Zero to JavaScript" class at the Automattic 2018 Grand Meetup.
